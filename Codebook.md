# Codebook

This codebook describes the variables used. The file contains header lines which represent their names.
The first line represents the mean of all following values.

The file has 79 columns, showing each one measurement from 3 angles (X, Y, Z).
The columns have followin names:

"1" "accmean()x"
"2" "accmean()y"
"3" "accmean()z"
"4" "gravityaccmean()x"
"5" "gravityaccmean()y"
"6" "gravityaccmean()z"
